## Problem 5.1

Find the currents in the unbalanced Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 5.1). Assume
that $v_0 = 1.5 V$, $r_1 = r_2 = 100 \Omega$, $r_3 = 150 \Omega$, $r_x = 120 \Omega$, $r_a = 1000 \Omega$, and $r_s = 10 \Omega$.

Use Gaussian elimination with partial-pivoting. Vary v0 and plot your answers versus v0.

## Problem 5.5

Apply the secant method to obtain the stable geometric structure of clusters of ions (Na+)$_n$ (Cl-)$_m$, where $n$ and $m$ are small positive integers. Use the empirical interaction potential given in Eq. (5.64) for the ions.

$$ V(r_{ij})=\eta_{ij}\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon r_{ij}}+\delta_{ij}V_0e^{-r_{ij}/r_0} $$

Consider the following cases for n and m: (n=1, m=1), (n=2, m=1), (n=2, m=2), and (n=3, m=2).

Present your results using two methods:

1. Create a table of solutions where the coordinates are listed for all these (n, m) combinations.

2. Use a plotting or drawing package to create geometrically accurate "ball and stick" drawings of your molecules.

Note that Fig. 5.2 in your text plots a stable structure for the n=3, m=2 case, so no need to plot that case. Example drawing packages include: the 2D plotting package you've been using, Google Slides, or something more sophisticated (if you're interested):

Hint: Use symmetry to simplify and reduce the number of variables to solve for.
